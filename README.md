# Bank_Customer_Churn_Prediction
Machine Learning project to predict bank customer churn using classification models and Streamlit for live demo.

A Machine Learning project that predicts whether a bank customer is likely to exit (churn) or stay, based on their profile and account activity.
Built using classification algorithms and deployed with Streamlit for an interactive live demo.

 **Project Overview** :  Customer churn is a major challenge for banks. This project helps identify customers who are likely to leave, allowing proactive retention strategies.
                         The model is trained on the Bank Customer Churn dataset and uses multiple ML algorithms to find the best performer.

**Tech Stack**
1)Python
2)Pandas, NumPy – Data preprocessing.
3)Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn – Model building & SMOTE balancing.
4)Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization.
5)Streamlit – Web app deployment.

 Model Training : Trained using several algorithms:

1)Logistic Regression
2)Support Vector Machine (SVM)
3)K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
4)Decision Tree Classifier
5)Random Forest Classifier
6)Gradient Boosting Classifier

✅ Best Model: Random Forest Classifier

 Key Steps :
->Data cleaning & preprocessing..
->Handling class imbalance using SMOTE.
->Model comparison based on accuracy.
->Saving the best model with pickle.
->Building a user-friendly Streamlit interface.

***Results***

1.Achieved high accuracy with Random Forest Classifier.
2.Built an interactive UI to test new customer data.
3.Provides instant prediction: “Customer will Exit” or “Customer will Stay”.
